This testrun uses the ramp_power.py script to run all four motors with the folowing ramp parameters:
Subtest 1: stepping: 0x100, delay: 0.1s
Subtest 2: stepping: 0x1000, delay: 1s 
Subtest 3: stepping: 0x1000, delay: 5s
Subtest 4: stepping: 0x4000, delay: 10s
Subtest 5: stepping: 0x4000, delay: 30s
Test 1: crazyflie bolted to ground
Test 2: crazyflie hoisted in the air

ramp_power.py logging in files rampN.log (rampN_test*.csv)
Header for ramp*.csv:
time, m1_pwm, m2_pwm, m3_pwm, m4_pwm, set_pwm, calc_volt_m1, calc_volt_m2, calc_volt_m3, calc_volt_m4
time is in ms. (50ms sample rate)

Two Keysight osc. are used to measure the voltage across and shunt resistor voltage of motors 1 and 2.
